                  Busia County, located in western Kenya, faces a complex
                  interplay of socioeconomic challenges. Poverty remains a
                  significant concern, with a substantial portion of the
                  population living below the poverty line. Agriculture, while a
                  primary livelihood, is often characterised by small-scale
                  farming and vulnerability to climatic variations.

                  This contributes to food insecurity, affecting the nutritional
                  well-being of many residents, particularly children.
                  Illiteracy, though being addressed, still hinders progress,
                  limiting access to information and opportunities.

                  Youth unemployability poses a substantial hurdle, as limited
                  vocational training and job opportunities restrict their
                  ability to secure stable livelihoods. These factors create a
                  cycle of vulnerability, demanding comprehensive strategies to
                  foster sustainable development.

                  Livelihoods in Busia County are primarily rooted in
                  agriculture, with maize, beans, and sugarcane being key crops.
                  However, reliance on rain-fed agriculture makes livelihoods
                  susceptible to drought and unpredictable weather patterns.
                  Cross-border trade, due to Busiaâ€™s location, provides some
                  economic activity, but it can be volatile
                </p>

                  The county faces challenges in providing adequate
                  infrastructure, including access to clean water, sanitation,
                  and healthcare. Educational resources are often strained,
                  impacting the quality of education and contributing to
                  disparities. To address these issues, initiatives focusing on
                  diversifying livelihoods, improving agricultural practices,
                  enhancing educational opportunities, and strengthening
                  infrastructure are crucial. The need for programs that empower
                  the youth, and improve food security are also of great
                  importance.
