          <!-- Introduction -->
          <p>
            This initiative is in line with the UK's Digital Development
            Strategy 2024-2030, focusing on the digital transformation of
            societies. It seeks to foster civic/democratic engagement and
            enhance access to reliable and contextually pertinent information
            across sectors like agriculture, health, local news, civic
            involvement, employment, online safety/security, and education among
            others.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project aims to empower marginalized voices, including
            vulnerable women, girls, youth, and Persons with Disabilities
            (PWDs), uphold human rights, and bolster the capabilities of local
            civil society to utilize digital technologies for self-organization
            and tackling developmental issues such as food security, well-being,
            education, employment, access to essential government services,
            online safety/security and livelihoods.

          <!-- Introduction -->
          <p>
            “Strengthening Digital Communities: Narrowing the Digital Divide in
            Two Kenyan Counties (Arid & Semi-Arid Lands' Mandera and Non-ASAL
            But Food-Insecure Busia)" addresses the digital divide affecting
            women, senior citizens, youths, who may be small-scale traders,
            drivers, farmers, and Persons with Disabilities, who are hindered
            from participating fully in the digital economy due to lack of
            access to essential digital resources including skills, digital
            services including in Agriculture and government. Tackling the
            urban-rural digital divide along the lines of gender, age and
            disability, will be crucial so that marginalised groups can benefit
            from investments in digital infrastructure, skills and services. The
            project aims to overcome barriers women and girls face, particularly
            in the rural areas. They include issues of online safety including
            technology-facilitated gender-based violence (TFGBV); lack of
            necessary skills, both digital (functional, technical and
            behavioural) and literacy skills to engage in the digital world; and
            gender norms which affect the perception on who should engage
            online.
          </p>
          <p>
            Digital divide are more apparent in rural communities where
            livelihoods are closely and intricately intertwined with food
            production. The project will be implemented in counties with high
            food poverty incidence levels in Kenya :Mandera (65%) and Busia
            (49%). Other Counties in this range include; Turkana (63.4%),
            Samburu (60.2%), Marsabit (55.1%), Tana River (49.5%), Busia (49%).
          </p>

          <p>
            Building on the successes of previous initiatives by UKDAP Partners,
            the project encompasses various strategies to promote digital
            inclusion in key sectors, including digital services in agriculture,
            digital employability for young women/youth, and cyber hygiene
            awareness/sensitization campaigns, These efforts have demonstrated
            the effectiveness of targeted interventions in overcoming the
            digital divide, with notable achievements such as increasing
            farmers' income through digital services, increasing income for
            young women through digital employability skilling. The Government
            of Kenya has priorities on emerging technology and we will work
            jointly to incorporate equality considerations in the GoK’s digital
            tech and innovation priorities. The County Government of Busia has
            developed a digitally enabled strategy referred to as the Ward Based
            Agriculture Sector Driven Rural Economic Revitalization Program
            (WASRERP)." Preliminary analysis of household data collected by the
            County reveals that out of the 142,159 households already mapped,
            majority (57%) of households are led women, 12% headed by widows,
            and 26% headed youth (18-35 years). 96% of the households practice
            crop production and 58% livestock production. Fish farming is
            scarcely practised.

          <!-- Introduction -->
          <p>
            This project aims to contribute to the UK Government's initiative on
            addressing the digital divide by assisting five million women,
            girls, PWDs, and youth in Kenya by 2027 in engaging safely and
            productively in the digital realm.

          <p>
            This is a three-year project (FY 2024/2025 to FY 2027/2028), funded
            annually, and will undertake several key activities aimed at
            enhancing digital access and skills, as well as exposing digital
            opportunities for various demographic groups, including women and
            girls, Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), senior citizens, youths,
            small-scale traders, and drivers.
